### Device Won't Boot

**Symptoms**: Black screen, no response when powered on
**Solutions**:

- âœ… Verify power source provides sufficient current (2A recommended)
- âœ… Check all hardware connections are secure
- âœ… Try a different SD card with fresh SeedSigner image
- âœ… Test with a different power cable

- âœ… For dice rolls, use proper physical dice (not digital)
- âœ… Double-check seed word transcription during backup
- âœ… Run the backup verification process

### Button Response Issues

- âœ… Clean around buttons to remove debris
- âœ… Check for physical damage to the WaveShare hat
- âœ… Try different button combinations (A, B, C all function identically)

### Display Problems

**Symptoms**: Screen flickering, partial display, wrong colors
**Solutions**:

- âœ… Check WaveShare hat connections
- âœ… Run Hardware I/O Test display test

- âœ… Check QR code quality and clarity
- âœ… Ensure proper lighting and camera positioning

### "Invalid Seed"

**Meaning**: The entered seed phrase doesn't pass BIP-39 validation
**Solutions**:

- âœ… Double-check every word in your seed phrase
- âœ… Verify word order is correct
- âœ… Ensure all words are from the BIP-39 wordlist
- âœ… Check for typos in manual entry

### "Checksum Error"

**Meaning**: The final word doesn't match the required checksum
**Solutions**:

- âœ… Use the "Calc 12th/24th word" tool to find the correct final word
